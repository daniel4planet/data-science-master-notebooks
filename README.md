# 📚 Data Science Master Notebooks

This repository contains some of the notebooks developed during my Data Science Master's program. The content is organized by topic, covering data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, NLP, time series, big data technologies, and more.

These notebooks form the technical foundation for my upcoming AI-based sustainability and environmental projects.

## 🧠 Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to a subject area from the master's curriculum. Notebooks are primarily written in Python, with a few in R.

- `Big-Data-Technology-and-Cloud-Solutions/`
- `Business-Intelligence-and-Visualization/`
- `Data-Analytics-and-Visualization/`
- `Deep-Learning/`
- `Machine-Learning/`
- `Natural-Language-Processing/`
- `Statistical-Methods/`
- `Time-Series-Analysis/`

Language-specific folders (`/python`, `/r`) are used when applicable.
